PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences.
### Method:
Create a Pandas DataFrame with 500 or more of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data. The analysis of the data will be split into three main parts, or stages.
#### Data Collection
1. more than 1,500 random latitudes and longitudes.
2. nearest city to the latitudes and longitudes.
3. current weather data from each unique city in your list.
5. Collected the following data from the JSON file :
- City, country, and date
- Latitude and longitude
- Maximum temperature
- Humidity
- Cloudiness
- Wind speed
#### Exploratory Analysis with Visualization
Analysis and visualization of:
- Latitude versus temperature
- Latitude versus humidity
- Latitude versus cloudiness
- Latitude versus wind speed

#### Visualize Travel Data
- Travel data Heatmaps
